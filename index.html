                This is a paragraph example, put in multiple
                lines, <strong>to make it look readable to folks.</strong>
                HTML will ignore spaces INSIDE any editors, so 
                try to make things look neat
                and readable for your fellow coders.

                <br>Test paragraph with space formatting <br>
                This is another line <br> I hope this works<br>

            <h1>The Learn Enough Story</h1>
                <p>
                    Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach
                    technical sophistication, the seemingly magical ability to take
                    command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes
                    everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts,
                    Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.
                    We believe there are at least a billion people who can benefit from
                    learning technical sophistication, probably more. To join our
                    movement, sign up for our official email list now.
