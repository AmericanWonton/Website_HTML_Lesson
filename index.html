                This is a paragraph example, put in multiple
                lines, <strong>to make it look readable to folks.</strong>
                HTML will ignore spaces INSIDE any editors, so 
                try to make things look neat
                and readable for your fellow coders.

                <br>Test paragraph with space formatting <br>
                This is another line <br> I hope this works<br>

            <h1>The Learn Enough Story</h1>
                <p>
                    Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach
                    <em>technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly magical ability to take
                    command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes
                    everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts,
                    Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.
                    We believe there are at least <strong>a billion people</strong> who can benefit from
                    learning technical sophistication, probably more. To join our

            <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>
                    Learn enough to Be Dangerous is an outgrowth of the 
                    <a href="https://railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> and the 
                    <a href="https://www.softvoer.io/">Softcover publishing platform</a>.
                    This page is part of the sample site for

            <h2>Founders</h2>
                <p>
                    Learn Enough to Be Dangerous was founded in 2015 by Michael Hartl, Lee
                    Donahoe, and Nick Merwin. We believe that the kind of technical
                    sophistication taught by the Learn Enough tutorials can benefit
                    at least <strong><em>a billion people</em></strong>, and probably more.

            <h3>Lee Donahoe</h3>
                <p>
                    When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder
                    stashes on his snowboard, you can find Lee in front of his computer
                    designing interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some of the 
                    interface-related Learn Enough tutorials. <br>

                    You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy
                    Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured, Nick is a true <em>Nerd</em>
                    at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-specc'd lines of code from a 
                    tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.<br>
