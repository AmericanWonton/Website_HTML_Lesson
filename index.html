                This is a paragraph example, put in multiple
                lines, <strong>to make it look readable to folks.</strong>
                HTML will ignore spaces INSIDE any editors, so 
                try to make things look neat
                and readable for your fellow coders.
            </p>

                <br>Test paragraph with space formatting <br>
                This is another line <br> I hope this works<br>
